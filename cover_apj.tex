Dear Editor,

%Please find enclosed our paper ``Minidisks in Binary Black Hole Accretion,'' which we are submitting exclusively to the Astrophysical Journal.  Please contact me for any correspondence concerning the manuscript, my email address is \texttt{gsr257@nyu.edu}.

Please find enclosed our revised paper ``Minidisks in Binary Black Hole Accretion.'' The changes suggested by the very kind referee report have been implemented, as well as some minor edits detailed below.

\begin{itemize}
	\item The typo, a second occurrence of ``be'' in the second sentence of the introduction, has been removed. 
	\item The first sentence of paragraph 3 of the introduction has been modified to qualify that cavities in circumbinary disks are not ubiquitous.
	\item A paragraph has been added to the end of the introduction indicating the focus of this work is on circumbinary accretion where a cavity has formed.
	\item The abbreviations HLLC, RK2-TVD, and CFL have been defined in their first appearance, the sixth paragraph of Section 2.
	\item A paragraph has been added to section 3 giving the formula for merger time due to gravitational wave emission and justifying our neglect of evolution of the binary orbital parameters.
	\item Two sentences giving the merger and orbital time for the $M=1 M_{\odot}$  and $M=10^6 M_{\odot}$ cases have been added to the last paragraph of section 3.
	\item A paragraph has been added to the end of section 6, discussing the effects of binary evolution on our results.
	\item References to Zhu et al 2016 and Artymowicz and Lubow 1994 have been added.
\end{itemize}

  Please contact me for any correspondence concerning the manuscript, my email address is \texttt{gsr257@nyu.edu}.
